Description: configuration settings framework for Qt
 KConfig provides an advanced configuration system. It is made of two
 parts: KConfigCore and KConfigGui.
 .
 KConfigCore provides access to the configuration files themselves. It
 features:
 .
  - centralized definition: define your configuration in an XML file
  and use `kconfig_compiler` to generate classes to read and write
  configuration entries.
  - lock-down (kiosk) support.
 .
 KConfigGui provides a way to hook widgets to the configuration so
 that they are automatically initialized from the configuration and
 automatically propagate their changes to their respective
 configuration files.
 .
 This package is part of KDE Frameworks 6.
 .
 This package contains runtime files for KConfig.
